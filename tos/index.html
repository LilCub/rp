            <h1>ICEFUSE NETWORKS TERMS OF SERVICE</h1>
            <br>
            <p>IMPORTANT! PLEASE READ CAREFULLY.
                THIS VERSION OF THE ICEFUSE.NET TERMS OF SERVICE WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE ON MARCH 20, 2017 AT 5:00 A.M.,
                E.S.T.</p>

            <p>Thank you for using the ICEFUSE.NET service (the “Service”). These Terms of service (the “Agreement”) set
                forth the terms and conditions under which you are provided access to the Service by Icefuse Networks, a
                united states company. (“Icefuse” or “we”). This Agreement does not supersede the End User License Agreement
                (the "EULA") that accompanies Icefuse's services (each a “service”) or any other specific Terms of service
                that accompanies a service (the “server-specific Terms of service”). The EULA governs your use of the
                service – that part of any service content installed on your computer – and this Agreement governs your use
                of the service. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the EULA and/or any
                service-specific Terms of service, the EULA and/or the service-Specific Terms of service shall govern and
                supersede the terms of this Agreement.</p>

            <p>YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS OF SERVICE AGREEMENT. BY USING THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE
                BOUND BY THIS LEGAL CONTRACT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MAY NOT
                USE THE SERVICE (AS DEFINED BELOW).</p>
