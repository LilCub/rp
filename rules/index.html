                      - Cannot break our server rules
- Just because a ticket is made and you can’t handle it doesn’t mean you don’t take it. Take it and go up CoC
- Do not disrespect players while in a sit (or anytime for that matter)
- Do not take bribes
- Do not go to a higher ranking staff member without permission
- Do not use your staff abilities in RP situations
- Do not spawn weapons or entities in RP ever. (Except for events by permission of Gamemaster)
- Do not Administrate your own situation when you are RPing, contact another staff member to deal with the problem. (If no other staff is present and the player is repeatedly breaking rules, you can handle the situation.)
- When you are staff you don't have "friends." Meaning you do not show favoritism toward your friends. (ex. Giving them ammo, failing to punish them for their misdeeds, defending a fail for your friends/faction etc.)
- Do not whitelist yourself to jobs/roles in which you are not trained for or approved to use. (ex. Making yourself a commander when you are not)
- Any staff caught on any other server breaking their rules or overall being unprofessional will be demoted.
- No one shall staff more than one server, executives are exempt from this policy.
- No staff can spawn themselves arrest batons to arrest or unarrest. The only time they can is when there are NO active ST on.
